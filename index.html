                    <p><em>"God often compromises our comfort in order to produce something even better in us: godly character.  .. His plan is not just to forgive us, but also to refine us by His grace.  We have been made positionally righteous by the work of Christ, but we are not yet purely righteous in the terms of the character of our hearts.  So, with refining grace, God works to make us what he has declared us to be in Christ.  We need sanctifying grace far more than we need comfortable lives." Paul David Tripp</em></p>
